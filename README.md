# Automated GUI Routine


This projects receives a routine of mouse clicks, defined by the user, and repeats it. 


How to use:
* Click a mouse button (right or left button);
* Press any keyboard key, other than ESC, to add another click;
* Press again mouse button, etc;
* When ESC is pressed, routine is finished and it is then repeated automatically.


Keyboard mimicking will be supported later.
